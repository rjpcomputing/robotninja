#summary Link to SWE Design document draft

The Runestone 2008 page is down for the moment, so I placed a link to our version
of the document here as well. We haven't done any major changes. Everything looked
good from the start. I've added the diagram and the gantt chart images to the
document with links to the full size images. Feel free to do as many changes as you
want! :)

Great job Adam & Jason!
