= Purpose =
----

Explain general robot construction and programming techniques used in the RobotNinja project. This article will also explain in detail how to setup NXC on a LEGO NXT brick. It also covers how to connect to it so that you can program the robot.

= Connecting via Bluetooth =
----
== Linux ==
  # Install Bluetooth packages:
{{{
sudo apt-get install bluez-utils bluez-pin
}}}
  # Make sure Bluetooth on your computer is turned on, then start the services:
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
}}}
  # Now turn Bluetooth on NXT brick on and let your computer scan for it:
{{{
hciconfig hci0
hcitool scan
}}}
   You should get something like this:
{{{
00:16:53:04:20:C9       NXT
}}}
  # Create a file `/etc/bluetooth/pin` containing plaintext "1234". (This is the default pin on the NXT, you may change it).
{{{
sdptool add --channel=3 SP
rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 3
}}}
   The NXT should now be able to find your computer (`Bluetoot>Search`). You need to enter the pin to connect.
  # To view the communication stream enter:
{{{
cat /dev/rfcomm0 | od -t x1 -w1 -v -Ax
}}}

Most of this comes from this [http://mtc.epfl.ch/courses/ProblemSolving-2007/nxt.html website].

I am not sure yet. I don't have any instructions planned for this yet.
