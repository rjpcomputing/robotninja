# Purpose #

leJOS (pronounced like the Spanish word "lejos" for "far") is a tiny Java Virtual Machine.

Describe how to install LeJOS and get the LeJOS firmware onto the brick. Most of these instructions come from the `readme.html` file that comes in the LeJOS download so they will not be repeated here.
